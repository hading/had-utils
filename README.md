# had-utils

My utility functions for Clojure, largely for Advent of Code
puzzles.

This stuff is only vaguely organized and you can probably find the
equivalent in a more polished library - these are mostly the result of
writing them being easier than tracking down a library that already
has them.

Given the stated goal, efficiency and careful error checking is
generally not a priority, and there are a lot of functions specialized
for those kinds of problems.
