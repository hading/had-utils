# had-utils

My utility functions for Clojure, largely for Advent of Code
puzzles.

This stuff is only vaguely organized and you can probably find the
equivalent in a more polished library - these are mostly the result of
writing them being easier than tracking down a library that already
has them.

Given the stated goal:

- There are a lot of functions specialized for those kinds of problems.
- Efficiency and careful error checking are generally not a priority.
