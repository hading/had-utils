# had-utils

My utility functions for Clojure, largely for Advent of Code
puzzles.

This stuff isn't even remotely organized yet. If I accumulate enough
of them maybe I will do better. You can probably find the equivalent
in a more polished library - these are mostly the result of writing
them being easier than tracking down a library that already has them.
